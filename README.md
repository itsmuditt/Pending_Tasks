# Pending_Tasks
An app in which you can list your tasks.

This app was created using Flutter for GUI.
In this app, you can basically write and store all your pending tasks or the tasks you are being assigned with currently.
These tasks that you write are being stored in a SQL database where all the CRUD operations make the relevant changes.

The CRUD operations:-
You can add a task [obviously]. [C]
You may mark it as done, upon which there will be an update in the database. [U]
If you feel like it, you can also delete all your completed tasks at the end of the day and have a sense of accomplishment. [D]
Everytime you open this app, it fetches all your undeleted tasks from it local database. [R]

Totally safe, no chance of breach of privacy as the database is stored locally and doesn't require internet.
Copy files from this repository and set them up in your flutter Project.
Do share your experience :)
